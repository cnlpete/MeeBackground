MeeBackground
==============

MeeBackground is a Wallpaper App for the Nokia N9 smartphone, written using Qt/QML.
It was inspired by [Wleux](http://khertan.net/wleux) and [Mustr](http://thp.io/2012/mustr), but adds the possibility to store favorites.

It uses the [DesktopPr API](https://www.desktoppr.co/api).
